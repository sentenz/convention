# Architecture Decision Records

[Architecture decision records (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/) help to explain why your infrastructure or application teams make certain design choices.

An ADR captures the key options available, the main requirements that drive a decision, and the design decisions themselves. ADRs are often stored in a Markdown file close to the code base relevant to that decision. If someone needs to understand the background of a specific architectural decision, such as why you use a Kubernetes cluster, they can review the ADR and then the associated code.

ADRs can also help you run more reliable applications and services. The ADR helps you understand your current state and troubleshoot when there's a problem. ADRs also build a collection of engineering decisions to help future decision choices and deployments.

# Architecture Modeling Concepts

Software architecture involves the high level structure of software system abstraction, by using decomposition and composition, with architectural style and quality attributes. The architecture design must conform to the major functionality and performance requirements of the system, as well as satisfy the [non-functional](software-testing.md#non-functional-testing) requirements such as reliability, scalability, portability, and availability. A software architecture must describe its group of components, their connections, interactions among them and deployment configuration of all components.

## Enterprise Architecture (EA)

Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline for proactively and holistically leading enterprise responses to disruptive forces by identifying and analyzing the execution of change toward desired business vision and outcomes. EA delivers value by presenting business and IT leaders with signature-ready recommendations for adjusting policies and projects to achieve targeted business outcomes that capitalize on relevant business disruptions.

## Solution Architecture (SA)

A solution architecture (SA) is an architectural description of a specific solution. SAs combine guidance from different enterprise architecture viewpoints (business, information and technical), as well as from the enterprise architecture (ES).

## Technical Architecture (TA)

Technical Architecture (TA) realize specific technical implementation processes. Since this requires a high level of in-depth expertise, Technical Architects usually specialize in a single technology. Therefore, they are named after their area of knowledge, e.g. Java or Python architect. Like Data, Application or Information Architects, Technical Architects fall under the umbrella of Domain Architects. Overall, these roles put technological solutions into practice and ensure that application designs support the technological strategy defined by the Enterprise Architect. However, Technical Architects are not only responsible for implementing new technologies. They also make recommendations and inform stakeholders about potential threats.

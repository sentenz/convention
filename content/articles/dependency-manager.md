## 1. Category

> [!NOTE]
> A Dependency Manager and a Package Manager differ in that a Package Manager primarily focuses on the distribution and installation of software packages, while a Dependency Manager focuses on managing the dependencies of a project, ensuring that the correct versions of libraries are used and resolving any conflicts between them.

### 1.1. C/C++

#### 1.1.1. Vcpkg

[Vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) is a dependency manager for C/C++ libraries designed for C and C++ projects on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It can be used to install packages from a variety of sources, including the official C++ package repositories and custom registry repositories.

1. Concepts and Components

    - Manifest Files
      > Files that define the dependencies for a project. Manifest files allow developers to declare the libraries and their versions that the project depends on.

    - Lockfiles
      > Files that record the exact versions of dependencies used in a project. Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds by locking down the entire dependency tree.

2. Files and Folders

    - `vcpkg.json`
      > `vcpkg.json` is the manifest file used by Vcpkg to define the dependencies for a C/C++ project. It allows developers to declare the libraries and their versions that the project depends on.

    - `vcpkg-lock.json`
      > `vcpkg-lock.json` is the lockfile used by Vcpkg to pin the exact versions of dependencies used in a project. Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds by locking down the entire dependency tree.

3. Examples and Explanations

    - `vcpkg.json`

      ```json
      {
        "name": "my-cpp-project",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "dependencies": [
          "fmt",
          "boost"
        ]
      }
      ```

    - `vcpkg-lock.json`

      ```bash
      vcpkg install --manifest
      ```

      ```json
      {
        "version": 1,
        "dependencies": {
          "fmt": {
            "version": "8.0.1",

### 1.5. Rust

#### 1.5.1. Cargo

[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) is the official dependency manager for the Rust programming language. It can be used to manage dependencies, build projects, and publish packages.

1. Concepts and Components

    - Manifest Files
      > Files that define the dependencies for a project. Manifest files allow developers to declare the libraries and their versions that the project depends on.

    - [Lockfiles](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html)
      > Files that record the exact versions of dependencies used in a project. Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds by locking down the entire dependency tree.

2. Files and Folders

    - `Cargo.toml`
      > `Cargo.toml` is the manifest file used by Cargo to define the dependencies for a Rust project. It allows developers to declare the libraries and their versions that the project depends on.

    - `Cargo.lock`
      > `Cargo.lock` is the lockfile used by Cargo to pin the exact versions of dependencies used in a project. Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds by locking down the entire dependency tree.

3. Examples and Explanations

    - `Cargo.toml`

      ```toml
      [package]
      name = "hello_world"
      version = "0.1.0"

      [dependencies]
      regex = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git" }
      ```

    - `Cargo.lock`

      ```bash
      cargo build
      ```

      ```toml
      [[package]]
      name = "hello_world"
      version = "0.1.0"
      dependencies = [
      "regex 1.5.0 (git+https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git#9f9f693768c584971a4d53bc3c586c33ed3a6831)",
      ]

      [[package]]
      name = "regex"
      version = "1.5.0"
      source = "git+https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git#9f9f693768c584971a4d53bc3c586c33ed3a6831"
      ```

### 1.6. Go

#### 1.6.1. Go Modules

[Go Modules](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-dependencies) is the official dependency management system for the Go programming language. It is a declarative system that is based on the Go module repository.

1. Concepts and Components

    - Modules
      > A module is a collection of related Go packages that are versioned together as a single unit. Modules are defined by a `go.mod` file, which specifies the module's path and its dependencies.

    - Versioning
      > Go Modules use semantic versioning to manage dependencies. Versions are specified in the `go.mod` file, allowing developers to pin dependencies to specific versions or version ranges.

2. Files and Folders

    - `go.mod`
      > `go.mod` is the manifest file used by Go Modules to define the dependencies for a Go project. It allows developers to declare the libraries and their versions that the project depends on.

    - `go.sum`
      > `go.sum` is the lockfile used by Go Modules to pin the exact versions of dependencies used in a project. Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds by locking down the entire dependency tree.

3. Examples and Explanations

    - `go.mod`

      ```go
      module github.com/example/my-go-app

      go 1.16

      require (
          github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.7.4
          github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.8.1
      )
      ```

    - `go.sum`

      ```plaintext
      github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.7.4 h1:...
      github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.7.4/go.mod h1:...
      github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.8.1 h1:...
      github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.8.1/go.mod h1:...
      ```

### 1.7. Java / JVM

#### 1.7.1. Maven

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a popular dependency manager for Java and JVM-based projects. It uses a declarative XML file called `pom.xml` to manage project dependencies, build configurations, and plugins.

1. Concepts and Components

    - POM (Project Object Model)
      > The POM file is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. It contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.

2. Files and Folders

    - `pom.xml`
      > `pom.xml` is the XML file used by Maven to define the dependencies for a Java project. It allows developers to declare the libraries and their versions that the project depends on.

3. Examples and Explanations

    - `pom.xml`

      ```xml
      <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
               xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
               xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                                   http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
          <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
          <groupId>com.example</groupId>
          <artifactId>my-java-app</artifactId>
          <version>1.0.0</version>

          <dependencies>
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
                  <version>2.5.4</version>
              </dependency>
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
                  <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
                  <version>2.12.4</version>
              </dependency>
          </dependencies>
      </project>
      ```

#### 1.7.2. Gradle

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is dependency manager for Java and JVM-based projects. It uses a Groovy or Kotlin-based DSL to define project dependencies and build configurations.

1. Concepts and Components

    - Build Scripts
      > Gradle uses build scripts to define the dependencies for a project. Build scripts allow developers to declare the libraries and their versions that the project depends on.

    - Lockfiles
      > Files that record the exact versions of dependencies used in a project. Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds by locking down the entire dependency tree.

2. Files and Folders

    - `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts`
      > `build.gradle` (Groovy) or `build.gradle.kts` (Kotlin) is the build script used by Gradle to define the dependencies for a Java project. It allows developers to declare the libraries and their versions that the project depends on.

    - `gradle.lockfile`
      > `gradle.lockfile` is the lockfile used by Gradle to pin the exact versions of dependencies used in a project. Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds by locking down the entire dependency tree.

3. Examples and Explanations

    - `build.gradle`

      ```groovy
      plugins {
          id 'java'
      }

      group 'com.example'
      version '1.0.0'

      repositories {
          mavenCentral()
      }

      dependencies {
          implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:2.5.4'
          implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.12.4'
      }
      ```

    - `gradle.lockfile`

      ```bash
      ./gradlew dependencies --write-locks
      ```

      ```plaintext
      org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:2.5.4
      com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.12.4
      ```

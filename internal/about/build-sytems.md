## CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) controls the software compilation process using platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces used in the compiler environment of choice.

## Makefile

[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files. Make gets its knowledge of how to build the program from a file called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other files.

## Gradle

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build automation tool for multi-language software development. It controls the development process in the tasks of compilation and packaging to testing, deployment, and publishing. Supported languages include Java (as well as Kotlin, Groovy, Scala), C/C++, and JavaScript.

# Build Systems // TODO

A build system is a program for the automated generation of software.

- [CMake](#cmake)
- [Makefile](#makefile)
- [Gradle](#gradle)
- [Ninja](#ninja)
- [Autotools](#autotools)

## CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.

## Makefile

[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files. Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other files.

# Comment

In computer programming, a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.

## Tags

Programmers may use informal tags in comments to assist in indexing common issues.

Tags differ, but might include:

- BUG
  > A known bug that should be corrected.

- FIXME
  > Should be corrected. Typically intended to be short-lived.

- TODO
  > Something to be done. Typically intended to be short-lived.

- HACK
  > A workaround.

- NOTE
  > Used to highlight especially notable gotchas.

- UNDONE
  > A reversal or `roll back` of previous code.

- XXX
  > Warn other programmers of problematic or misguiding code, e.g. [technical dept](technical-dept.md).

- NIT
  > Some style points that would improve the code, but are not mandatory.

# Continuous Pipelines

Continuous Pipelines refer to the process of automating the software development workflow from code creation to deployment. This process involves multiple stages such as code integration, build, testing, and deployment to production. The pipeline runs continuously, ensuring that every change made to the code is automatically built, tested, and deployed, providing quick feedback to the development team and enabling faster delivery of new features to customers. By automating this process, organizations can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and increase the speed of delivering software updates.

### 1.1. Continuous Verification

Continuous Verification refers to the practice of continuously verifying the quality and functionality of software applications and systems. This can involve automating the process of testing and validating code changes, and can help organizations to catch and fix bugs and other issues before they are deployed to production. Continuous Verification helps to ensure that software is of high quality and reliable, and can improve the overall stability and user experience of applications.

### 1.2. Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice of automating the process of integrating code changes from multiple developers into a single version control repository. This process typically involves building and testing the code changes as soon as they are committed to the repository, and providing feedback to developers on the quality and stability of their changes. The goal of CI is to catch issues early in the development process and promote collaboration among team members.

### 1.3. Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a set of practices and techniques that aim to automate the process of delivering code changes from the development environment to production. This process typically involves testing and verifying code changes at multiple stages, such as build, test, and deployment, before they are released to production. CD helps to ensure that code changes are deployed quickly, with minimal manual intervention, and with confidence in their quality and stability.

### 1.4. Continuous Deployment

Continuous Continuous Deployment (CD) is an extension of Continuous Delivery that automates the deployment of code changes to production as soon as they pass all necessary tests and approvals. This practice is typically used in organizations that have high levels of automation and a strong focus on rapid and frequent delivery of code changes.

### 1.5. Continuous Build

Continuous Build refers to the practice of automatically building and compiling software applications and systems, whenever changes are committed to the source code repository. This can involve automating the process of building, compiling, and packaging software, and can help organizations to ensure that software is always up-to-date and ready for deployment. Continuous Build helps to speed up the software development process, reduce errors and inconsistencies, and improve the overall efficiency of software development and deployment.

### 1.6. Continuous Testing

Continuous Testing refers to the practice of automating the process of testing code changes throughout the software development lifecycle. This process typically involves the use of test automation tools and scripts that run automatically as code changes are committed, built, and deployed. Continuous Testing helps to ensure that code changes are thoroughly tested and validated before they are released to production, reducing the risk of defects and improving the overall quality of the software.

### 1.7. Continuous Feedback

Continuous Feedback refers to the practice of providing real-time feedback to developers on the quality and performance of their code changes. This can include feedback from automated testing tools, performance metrics, and user feedback, among other sources. The goal of Continuous Feedback is to provide developers with quick and actionable insights into the quality and stability of their code changes, and to promote continuous improvement in the software development process.

### 1.8. Continuous Monitoring

Continuous Monitoring refers to the practice of monitoring the performance and stability of software applications in production, and proactively addressing any issues that may arise. This process typically involves collecting and analyzing performance and log data, as well as monitoring system health and availability. Continuous Monitoring helps to ensure that software applications are performing optimally in production, and helps to minimize downtime and resolve issues quickly.

### 1.9. Continuous Optimization

Continuous Optimization refers to the practice of continuously improving and refining the Continuous Pipeline to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and improve the speed of delivery. This can involve changes to the pipeline itself, as well as improvements to the underlying infrastructure and tools, and can involve a combination of technical and organizational changes. The goal of Continuous Optimization is to improve the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the software development process, and to support the delivery of high-quality software to customers.

### 1.10. Continuous Compliance

Continuous Compliance refers to the practice of ensuring that software applications and systems comply with relevant regulations and standards throughout their lifecycle. This can involve automating the process of verifying compliance with data privacy, security, and other regulatory requirements, and can help organizations to reduce the risk of non-compliance and penalties.

### 1.11. Continuous Security

Continuous Security refers to the practice of integrating security into the software development lifecycle, and continuously monitoring and verifying the security of applications and systems. This can involve automated security testing, security scans, and regular security audits, and helps organizations to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

### 1.12. Continuous Documentation

Continuous Documentation refers to the practice of maintaining up-to-date and accurate documentation of software applications and systems, and ensuring that documentation is automatically updated as code changes are committed and deployed. This helps to ensure that developers and other stakeholders have access to the most current and accurate information about the software, and can help to reduce errors and improve collaboration.

### 1.13. Continuous Training

Continuous Training refers to the practice of providing ongoing training and development opportunities for developers, DevOps teams, and other stakeholders involved in the software development process. This can include training on new technologies, tools, and methodologies, as well as opportunities for hands-on experience and collaboration. Continuous Training helps organizations to build a skilled and knowledgeable workforce, and to continuously improve the software development process.

## 2. Principle

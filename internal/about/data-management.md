# Data Management

[Data Management](https://www.axiomdatascience.com/best-practices/index.html) plans help to ensure that your data are well-organized, managed, and prepared for preservation into the future. Use a data management plan to document the planned research effort, the expected outputs, and the plan for documenting and archiving data.

## 2. File Structure

A successful [file structure](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/file-structure/) organizes your data and code with the goal of repeatability, making it easier for you and your collaborators to revisit, revise and develop your project. File structures are not fixed entities, but rather build a framework that communicates the function and purpose of elements within a project by separating concerns into a hierarchy of folders and using consistent, chronological, and descriptive names.

### 2.1. File Naming Convention

The naming rule is: `[YYYYMMDD]_[type]_[scope]_[author]_[title]_[subtitle]_[version]`.

- `YYYYMMDD`
  > Refers to the creation date according to the ISO 8601 date format: 20220401.

- `type`
  > Refers to the document abbreviation or a document no.: mm or 1234.
  >
  > - mm (meeting minute)

- `scope`
  > Refers to the scope of the document: internal.
  >
  > - internal
  > - cu (customer)
  > - su (supplier)

- `author`
  > Refers to the name, department, category of the document author: s.
  >
  > - s (sentenz)

- `title`
  > Refers to the title of the project: iphone-13.

- `subtitle`
  > Refers to the subtitle of the project: mini.

- `version`
  > Refers to the version of the document, default v01: v01.

# Database

A database is a collection of structured data that is organized and stored in a way that enables efficient retrieval and manipulation of the data. A database can be used to store and manage data for a variety of purposes, such as maintaining a record of transactions, storing customer information, or tracking inventory.

Databases are typically managed by a database management system (DBMS), which provides a set of tools and interfaces for creating, modifying, and querying the data stored in the database. This can include a graphical user interface for managing the database, or a set of command-line tools and programming APIs for accessing and manipulating the data programmatically.

#### 1.2.1. DBMS

A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. A DBMS manages the organization, manipulation, storage, and retrieval of data, and provides an interface for interaction with the data.

Key functions of a DBMS include:

- Data Storage
  > A DBMS provides a centralized repository for storing data, which can be organized into tables and other structures.

- Data Retrieval
  > A DBMS allows users to retrieve specific data from the database, either through queries or by browsing the data directly.

- Data Manipulation
  > A DBMS provides a set of tools for modifying and updating data in the database, including adding new records, deleting existing records, and modifying existing data.

- Data Security
  > A DBMS provides a variety of security features to protect the data in the database, including authentication, authorization, and access control.

- Data Consistency
  > A DBMS provides a set of features to ensure the consistency and reliability of the data in the database, including transaction management and data validation.

#### 1.2.2. Transaction

A transaction in database systems refers to a unit of work that is executed within a database management system (DBMS). The primary objective of transactions is to maintain the consistency and integrity of data within a database, by ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state even in the face of failures or errors. Transactions achieve this objective by implementing the Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties, which guarantee that either all the operations within a transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are completed at all.

#### 1.2.3. ACID

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that ensure the consistency and reliability of database transactions.

ACID properties ensure that database transactions are reliable, consistent, and resistant to failures or data loss.

- Atomicity
  > Atomicity property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work, either completing fully or rolling back completely in the event of a failure. This ensures that the database remains in a consistent state, even if part of the transaction fails.

- Consistency
  > Consistency property ensures that a transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another, without introducing any invalid data. This is typically achieved through the use of constraints and data validation.

- Isolation
  > Isolation property ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, and that each transaction is executed as if it were the only transaction taking place. This prevents data corruption and other issues that could arise from multiple transactions accessing the same data simultaneously.

- Durability
  > Durability property ensures that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and cannot be lost in the event of a failure. This is achieved through the use of transaction logs, backups, and other measures.

#### 1.2.4. CRUD

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a set of basic operations that can be performed on a database, and is used to manage data in a database.

The CRUD operations are the foundation of most database management systems, and are used to perform the basic functions of managing data in a database.

- Create
  > Create operation allows a user to add new data to a database. This can include creating new records, tables, or other structures in the database.

- Read
  > Read operation allows a user to retrieve data from a database. This can include reading specific records, performing searches, or retrieving data for reporting purposes.

- Update
  > Update operation allows a user to modify existing data in a database. This can include updating existing records, adding new fields to tables, or changing the structure of the database.

- Delete
  > Delete operation allows a user to remove data from a database. This can include deleting individual records, tables, or other structures in the database.

#### 1.2.9. Streaming

Streaming refers to the process of continuously receiving and processing data in real-time. In database systems, streaming can be used to handle large amounts of data that are generated in real-time, such as IoT data or social media data.

#### 1.2.10. Geospatial

Time series databases are optimized for the storage and management of large amounts of time-based data, and are widely used in industries such as finance, IoT, and weather forecasting.

#### 1.2.12. Distributed Tables

Distributed tables are tables in a database that are spread across multiple nodes in a distributed database system. Distributed tables provide a way to scale databases horizontally, allowing for the storage and management of large amounts of data across multiple nodes. This provides increased performance and scalability, as well as improved fault tolerance.

#### 1.2.13. Schema Design

Schema design is a critical component of database architecture and design, as it defines the structure of the data in a database. Schema design involves creating tables, columns, and relationships to represent the data requirements of an application. The schema defines the structure of the data and the relationships between the data elements, and it is used to ensure that the data is stored in a consistent and organized manner.

## 2. Principles

Everything as Code (XaC) is a concept that extends the idea of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to include various aspects of software development, deployment, and operations represented as code. While there is no standardized set of principles specifically labeled as XaC principles, the concept aligns with the principles of IaC and the general principles of software development and DevOps practices.

> NOTE XaC is a flexible concept, and its principles may be adapted and expanded based on the specific needs and goals of an organization. By adopting XaC principles, teams can foster a culture of automation, collaboration, and efficiency in software development, operations, and infrastructure management.

- Automation
  > Emphasize automation of processes wherever possible. Representing various aspects of software development, deployment, and operations as code allows for automation, reducing manual tasks and human error.

- Version Control
  > Apply version control to code representations of different components. This enables tracking changes, collaboration among team members, and the ability to roll back to previous states if needed.

- Reproducibility
  > Ensure that code-based representations are reproducible across different environments and stages of the development lifecycle. The same code should produce consistent results in different settings.

- Collaboration
  > Facilitate collaboration among teams, including developers, operations, and security, by using code repositories as a single source of truth for configurations and settings.

- Scalability
  > Design code representations to be scalable and easily adaptable to varying workloads and infrastructure requirements.

- Standardization
  > Promote standardization and consistency in configurations and settings across different components, environments, and teams.

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
  > Integrate Everything as Code practices into CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing, deployment, and management of various software and infrastructure components.

- Security by Design
  > Implement security measures and best practices as part of the code-based configurations to ensure security is integrated from the beginning.

- Immutable Infrastructure
  > Treat infrastructure as immutable by updating and redeploying code-based configurations rather than making changes directly on live systems.

- Documentation
  > Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation alongside code representations to facilitate understanding and maintainability.

- Testing and Validation
  > Implement automated testing and validation of code-based configurations to ensure correctness and compliance with desired outcomes.

- Continuous Improvement
  > Embrace continuous improvement by regularly reviewing and refining code-based representations based on feedback and lessons learned.

- Auditability and Compliance
  > Use code-based configurations to enhance auditability and compliance tracking, ensuring that systems meet industry regulations and internal policies.

## 3. Best Practice

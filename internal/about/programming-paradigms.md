# Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are broad approaches to solving computational problems through programming. These paradigms are used to classify programming languages based on the fundamental principles they use to express computational processes.

Programming paradigms are essential to understanding the underlying principles of programming languages and can help guide software design and development decisions.

## 1. Imperative Paradigm

Imperative paradigm represents algorithms as sequences of commands or statements that describe how to perform a computation. Languages in this paradigm include C, Pascal, and BASIC.

## 2. Object-Oriented Paradigm

Object-Oriented paradigm represents algorithms as objects and classes that encapsulate both data and behavior. Object-oriented programming languages include Java, Python, and Ruby.

## 3. Functional Paradigm

Functional paradigm represents algorithms as mathematical functions that can be combined and manipulated in a way that eliminates the need for state and mutable data. Languages in this paradigm include Haskell, Lisp, and Scheme.

## 4. Declarative Paradigm

Declarative paradigm represents algorithms as descriptions of the desired outcome, rather than instructions on how to compute it. Examples of declarative languages include SQL, Prolog, and Regular Expressions.

## 5. Logic Paradigm

Logic paradigm represents algorithms as statements in formal logic that can be used for theorem proving and other tasks. Examples of logic programming languages include Prolog and Mercury.

## 6. Event-Driven Paradigm

Event-Driven paradigm focuses on the asynchronous response to external events, and triggers functions based on specific events. Examples of event-driven languages include JavaScript and ActionScript.

## 7. Procedural Paradigm

Procedural paradigm represents algorithms as sequences of procedures or subroutines that can be executed step by step. Examples of procedural programming languages include FORTRAN, COBOL, and Algol.

## 8. Scripting Paradigm

Scripting paradigm represents algorithms as scripts that automate repetitive tasks. Examples of scripting languages include Perl, Python, and Ruby.

## 1. Category

The project layout can be divided into several categories, depending on the type of project, its size, and its complexity.

- Source code
  > This category includes all the files that contain the actual code for the project, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, or any other programming language files.

- Assets
  > This category includes all the files that are used by the source code, such as images, videos, audio files, or any other multimedia files.

- Libraries
  > This category includes any external libraries or dependencies that are required for the project, such as jQuery, Bootstrap, or React.

- Configuration
  > This category includes any files that configure the project environment or settings, such as configuration files for a web server, database settings, or other system settings.

- Documentation
  > This category includes any documentation related to the project, such as user guides, developer guides, API documentation, or any other type of documentation.

- Tests
  > This category includes all the files related to testing the project, such as unit tests, integration tests, or any other type of tests.

- Scripts
  > This category includes any files related to building the project, such as build scripts, deployment scripts, or any other type of scripts.

> NOTE The specific categories and the organization of files and folders within them can vary depending on the type of project and the development process being used.

### 1.1. Linear Layout

Linear layout is a simple layout where files are organized in a linear or chronological order. This type of layout is commonly used for small projects or projects with a simple structure.

Example of a Website project:

```md
.
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
├── about.html
└── contact.html
```

Example of a C project:

```md
.
├── main.c
├── functions.c
├── functions.h
├── input.txt
└── output.txt
```

### 1.2. Hierarchical Layout

In hierarchical layout, files are organized in a hierarchical structure, with folders containing subfolders and files. This layout is suitable for medium-sized projects with multiple components.

Example of a Website project:

```md
.
├── css
│   └── style.css
├── js
│   └── script.js
├── images
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── background.jpg
└── pages
    ├── index.html
    ├── about.html
    └── contact.html
```

Example of a C project:

```md
.
├── src
│   ├── main.c
│   ├── functions.c
│   └── functions.h
├── data
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── output.txt
└── Makefile
```

### 1.3. Modular Layout

In modular layout, the project is divided into modules, with each module containing its own files and resources. This layout is commonly used for large projects with many components.

Example of a Website project:

```md
.
├── header
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── nav.html
├── footer
│   ├── copyright.html
│   └── social-media.html
├── pages
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── about.html
│   └── contact.html
├── css
│   └── style.css
└── js
    └── script.js
```

Example of a C project:

```md
.
├── src
│   ├── header
│   │   ├── constants.h
│   │   └── structs.h
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── helper.c
│   │   └── helper.h
│   ├── module1
│   │   ├── module1.c
│   │   └── module1.h
│   └── main.c
├── data
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── output.txt
└── Makefile
```

### 1.4. Component-based Layout

Component-based layout is similar to the modular layout, but it emphasizes the relationships between different components of the project. This layout is commonly used for software development projects.

Example of a Website project:

```md
.
├── authentication
│   ├── login.html
│   ├── register.html
│   └── reset-password.html
├── blog
│   ├── index.html
│   └── post.html
├── products
│   ├── index.html
│   └── product.html
├── css
│   └── style.css
└── js
    └── script.js
```

Example of a C project:

```md
.
├── authentication
│   ├── login.c
│   ├── register.c
│   └── reset_password.c
├── blog
│   ├── blog.c
│   └── post.c
├── products
│   ├── products.c
│   └── product.c
├── utils
│   ├── helper.c
│   └── helper.h
├── main.c
└── Makefile
```

### 1.5. Functional Layout

In functional layout, files are organized according to their function or purpose. For example, all files related to user authentication might be grouped together in one folder. This layout is suitable for projects with many distinct functions or features.

Example of a Website project:

```md
.
├── css
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── layout.css
│   └── typography.css
├── js
│   ├── scripts.js
│   ├── menu.js
│   └── slider.js
├── authentication
│   ├── login.html
│   ├── register.html
│   └── reset-password.html
└── pages
    ├── index.html
    ├── about.html
    └── contact.html
```

Example of a C project:

```md
.
├── src
│   ├── header
│   │   ├── constants.h
│   │   └── structs.h
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── helper.c
│   │   └── helper.h
│   ├── authentication
│   │   ├── login.c
│   │   ├── register.c
│   │   └── reset_password.c
│   ├── blog
│   │   ├── blog.c
│   │   └── post.c
│   ├── products
│   │   ├── products.c
│   │   └── product.c
│   ├── menu.c
│   └── main.c
└── Makefile
```

### 1.6. Task-based Layout

In task-based layout, files are organized according to the tasks they are used for. For example, all files related to design might be grouped together, while all files related to development might be grouped together in a separate folder. This layout is suitable for projects with many different roles or responsibilities.

Example of a Website project:

```md
.
├── design
│   ├── mockups
│   │   ├── homepage.png
│   │   ├── about.png
│   │   └── contact.png
│   └── style-guide.html
├── development
│   ├── html
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── about.html
│   │   └── contact.html
│   ├── css
│   │   └── style.css
│   └── js
│       └── script.js
└── content
    ├── copy
    │   ├── homepage.txt
    │   ├── about.txt
    │   └── contact.txt
    └── images
        ├── logo.png
        └── background.jpg
```

Example of a C project:

```md
.
├── design
│   ├── mockups
│   │   ├── homepage.png
│   │   ├── about.png
│   │   └── contact.png
│   └── style-guide.txt
├── src
│   ├── header
│   │   ├── constants.h
│   │   └── structs.h
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── helper.c
│   │   └── helper.h
│   ├── authentication
│   │   ├── login.c
│   │   ├── register.c
│   │   └── reset_password.c
│   ├── blog
│   │   ├── blog.c
│   │   └── post.c
│   ├── products
│   │   ├── products.c
│   │   └── product.c
│   ├── menu.c
│   └── main.c
├── data
│   ├── copy
│   │   ├── homepage.txt
│   │   ├── about.txt
│   │   └── contact.txt
│   └── images
│       ├── logo.png
│       └── background.jpg
└── Makefile
```

## 2. Principle

A project layout should be designed with the needs of the development team and the project in mind. The layout should be easy to understand, consistent, and well-documented, and should facilitate collaboration and efficient development practices.

- Simplicity
  > A good project layout should be simple and easy to understand. The layout should be easy to navigate and should not require users to have an in-depth understanding of the project's inner workings.

- Consistency
  > The layout should be consistent across all files and directories. This makes it easier for users to find what they are looking for and reduces confusion.

- Modularity
  > The layout should be modular, with each directory containing files that are related to a specific aspect of the project. This makes it easier to maintain and update the project, as changes can be made to a specific module without affecting the entire project.

- Scalability
  > The layout should be scalable, meaning that it can be easily adapted to accommodate new features or functionality as the project grows.

- Flexibility
  > The layout should be flexible enough to accommodate different development workflows and methodologies. For example, if the team uses a specific build system or testing framework, the project layout should be able to accommodate these tools.

- Documentation
  > The project layout should be well-documented, with clear explanations of each directory and file. This makes it easier for new team members to get up to speed quickly and reduces confusion.

- Compatibility
  > The layout should be compatible with the tools and systems used by the team. For example, if the team uses Git for version control, the layout should be compatible with Git's file structure and branching model.

## 3. Best Practice

 By following these best practices, developers can create a project layout that is easy to manage and maintain, and that facilitates efficient development practices.

- Use a standard directory structure
  > Use a standard directory structure that is commonly used in the programming community. This makes it easier for other developers to understand the layout of the project and find the files they need.

- Keep the layout simple
  > The project layout should be simple and easy to understand. Avoid overly complex directory structures that may confuse developers.

- Separate source code from build artifacts
  > Keep source code in a separate directory from build artifacts, such as object files and executables. This makes it easier to clean the build directory without affecting the source code.

- Use descriptive names
  > Use descriptive names that accurately reflect the contents of each directory and file. Consistent naming makes it easier for team members to find what they are looking for and reduces confusion.

- Use version control
  > Use a version control system like Git to manage the project. This makes it easier to track changes, collaborate with other developers, and revert changes if necessary.

- Document the layout
  > Document the project layout in a README file or other documentation. This makes it easier for other developers to understand the layout and find the files they need.

- Include a clear README file
  > Include a clear README file in the root directory that provides an overview of the project and instructions for building and running it. This makes it easier to get up quickly.

- Be consistent
  > Be consistent with naming conventions, file organization, and directory structure throughout the project. This makes it easier for developers to find files and understand the layout.

- Use modular design
  > Use a modular design to separate different aspects of the project. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the project, and allows for easier testing and debugging.

- Keep third-party dependencies in a separate directory
  > Store third-party dependencies in a separate directory, such as `/external` or `/vendor`. This makes it easier to manage dependencies and avoid version conflicts.

- Include tests
  > Store tests in a separate directory, such as `/tests`. This makes it easier to run tests and ensure that the project functions as expected.

- Use relative paths
  > Use relative paths when referencing files and directories within the project. This makes it easier to move the project to a different directory or system without breaking file references.

- Minimize the number of directories
  > Use the minimum number of directories needed to organize the project. Too many directories can make it difficult to navigate and understand the project.

- Keep the layout flexible
  > Keep the project layout flexible enough to accommodate changes and updates over time. Don't be afraid to make changes to the layout as needed to improve organization and efficiency.

## 4. Terminology

Terminologies are used to describe the various components of a project layout and are important to understand when working on a software development project.

- Directory
  > A directory is a folder or container that holds files and other directories.

- File
  > A file is a collection of data that is stored in a directory. Files can be text, code, images, or any other type of data.

- Root directory
  > The root directory is the top-level directory in a file system. In Unix-based systems, the root directory is denoted by a forward slash (/).

- Source code
  > Source code is the human-readable code that is written by developers to create software applications.

- Header file
  > A header file is a file that contains function and variable declarations that are used in the source code.

- Build artifacts
  > Build artifacts are the files that are generated during the build process. These can include object files, executables, and libraries.

- Test code
  > Test code is code that is written to test the functionality of the software application.

- Documentation
  > Documentation is written material that explains how the software application works, how to use it, and how to troubleshoot any issues.

- Dependency
  > A dependency is a library or other software component that is required for the software application to run.

- Configuration
  > Configuration files are files that contain settings and parameters that are used to configure the software application.

- Module
  > A module is a self-contained unit of code that can be reused across multiple projects.

- Package
  > A package is a collection of related modules, files, and directories that are grouped together for easy distribution and installation. In many programming languages, packages are used to organize code into reusable and shareable components, and they often have a specific directory structure and naming conventions. Packages can be installed and managed using package managers, which automate the process of downloading and installing dependencies and other required files.

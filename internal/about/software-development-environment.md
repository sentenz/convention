# Software Development Environment

The Software Development Environment (SDE) refers to the overall set of tools, resources, and infrastructure that are used to develop, test, and deploy software applications. This includes hardware, software, development tools, source code management systems, testing frameworks, and production servers. The SDE is designed to support the entire software development process, from requirement gathering to deployment, and is a crucial component of software development projects. An SDE can consist of various components, such as integrated development environments (IDEs), version control systems, testing tools, and deployment platforms. SDE aims to provide a stable, secure, and efficient environment for software development and deployment, while also enabling developers to work efficiently and effectively.

## 1. Category

### 1.1. Development Environment

This environment is used for developing, testing and debugging software applications. It provides the necessary resources for developers to write code and create new features.

### 1.2. Test Environment

The test environment is used to validate the software application and to identify any issues that may arise during the testing process. This environment simulates the actual production environment to provide accurate testing results.

### 1.3. Staging Environment

The staging environment is a replica of the production environment, used to test and validate software applications before they are deployed to production. This environment is used to identify any issues or bugs before they impact the live production environment.

### 1.4. Integration Environment

The integration environment is used to integrate different components of software applications, such as APIs, databases, and servers. This environment is used to test and validate the integration of different systems before deployment to production.

### 1.5. Continuous Environment

The continuous environment is an automated environment that supports the [Continuous Pipelines](../about/continuous-pipelines.md), as integration and delivery of software applications. This environment is used to automate the build, test, analysis, security, and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to bring new features and updates to production. It allows teams to quickly identify and resolve issues, delivering high-quality software applications to end-users.

### 1.6. Production Environment

The production environment is the live environment where software applications are deployed and made available to the end-users. This environment is monitored closely to ensure the software is functioning correctly and meeting the performance and availability requirements of the business.

## 2. Best Practice

Best practices, to create a robust and efficient SDE that ensures high-quality software development and deployment.

- DevOps
  > In DevOps methodology, the software development environment (SDE) typically involves the following stages:
  >
  > - Development
  >
  >   This is the stage where software developers write and test code, debug issues, and create new features. Developers use integrated development environments (IDEs) and version control systems to manage their code.
  >
  > - Continuous Integration
  >
  >   This stage involves the automation of build and test processes. Code changes are integrated into a single repository, and automatic tests are run to validate the changes.
  >
  > - Continuous Deployment
  >
  >   In this stage, code changes are automatically deployed to the testing environment, where they are tested and validated.
  >
  > - Staging
  >
  >   This stage involves the testing of software applications in a controlled environment that mimics the production environment. This stage helps to identify any issues or bugs before they impact the live production environment.
  >
  > - Production
  >
  >   This is the final stage where software applications are deployed and made available to end-users. This stage is monitored closely to ensure the software is functioning correctly and meeting performance and availability requirements.
  >
  > - Continuous Monitoring
  >
  >   This stage involves the continuous monitoring of the production environment to identify and resolve any issues. This stage also involves collecting and analyzing data to improve the software development process.

- Standardization
  > The standardization of processes, tools, and coding conventions across the development team is important to ensure consistency and efficiency. This also allows developers to easily understand each other's code and collaborate more effectively.

- Version Control
  > Version control is essential to track changes made to the codebase and allows developers to collaborate without the risk of losing work. This helps to ensure that the codebase is consistent and accurate.

- Logging and Monitoring
  > [Logging and Monitoring](../about/logging-and-monitoring.md) are important for detecting and identifying issues in the software environment. This helps to identify performance issues, system failures, and other issues that may affect the end-users.

- Security
  > Security is critical to protect the software and data from unauthorized access or malicious attacks. This includes implementing secure coding practices, regularly reviewing and updating security protocols, and conducting penetration testing.

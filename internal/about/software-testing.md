## 1. Category

There are different types of software testing, including manual testing and automated testing. Manual testing involves executing test cases manually and observing the results. Automated testing involves the use of tools and scripts to automate the testing process.

Process of Software Testing:

- Planning
  > This phase involves defining the scope and objectives of testing, identifying the testing approach and techniques to be used, and determining the required resources and timelines.

- Designing
  > In this phase, test cases and test scenarios are developed based on the requirements and specifications of the software.

- Execution
  > During this phase, the developed test cases are executed to verify the functionality of the software.

- Reporting
  > The results of the testing are recorded and reported to stakeholders, including defects or issues found and recommendations for improvements.

- Retesting
  > If defects are identified, the software is retested to verify that the issues have been resolved.

### 1.1. Testing Patterns

Testing patterns are reusable techniques to common testing problems that can be used to improve the effectiveness of software testing. They allow to organize and structure test code in a way that is maintainable, scalable, and extensible.

#### 1.1.1. Arrange, Act, Assert

Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) is a software testing pattern that provides a structured and organized way to write unit tests. It helps make the tests more readable, maintainable, and easy to understand.

Feature of AAA:

- Arrange
  > Setup the test environment by creating the necessary objects, initializing variables, and providing input data required for the test. This step ensures that the unit under test (the code being tested) has the appropriate conditions to execute the test scenario correctly.

- Act
  > Involves executing the specific method or functionality of the unit to test. This typically involves calling a method or performing some action on the unit under test using the provided input data from the `Arrange` phase.

- Assert
  > Verify the outcome of the test. Check whether the actual result of the action taken in the `Act` phase matches the expected result that you defined during the `Arrange` phase. If the outcome is as expected, the test passes, otherwise, it fails, indicating a potential problem in the code.

Example of AAA:

```python
def test_add_numbers():
    # Arrange
    num1 = 5
    num2 = 10

    # Act
    result = add_numbers(num1, num2)

    # Assert
    assert result == 15, "Addition of two numbers failed."
```

#### 1.1.2. Given-When-Then

Given-When-Then (GWT) is a software testing pattern used for structuring and writing test scenarios, particularly in behavior-driven development (BDD) and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). GWT provides a more human-readable and expressive format for describing test cases and their expected behavior.

Features of GWT:

- Given
  > The `Given` section sets up the initial context or the preconditions for the test scenario. It describes the state of the system or the environment before the action being tested occurs. This typically includes creating objects, initializing variables, and any necessary setup steps.

- When
  > The `When` section represents the action or event that triggers the behavior being tested. It is the specific operation or method call that you want to verify for correctness.

- Then
  > The `Then` section defines the expected outcome or behavior of the system after the action in the `When` section has been performed. It includes assertions or expectations to check whether the actual result matches the expected result.

Example of GWT:

```python
def test_login_with_valid_credentials():
    # Given
    username = "admin"
    password = "password"

    # When
    response = login(username, password)

    # Then
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["message"] == "Login successful"
```

#### 1.1.3. Table-Driven Testing

Table-Driven Testing is a software testing technique in which test cases are organized in a tabular format, often using a spreadsheet or a list of input-output pairs. It is particularly useful for multiple similar test cases that can be represented in a systematic and concise manner. This approach is commonly used for testing functions or methods that take a set of input values and produce corresponding output values.

Table-Driven Testing separates the test case logic from the test code, making it easier to add, modify or remove test cases without changing the test implementation. It promotes maintainability and reduces duplication of test code.

> NOTE It's essential to strike a balance between using `Table-Driven Testing` and other testing techniques. While it works well for certain scenarios, not all test cases may fit neatly into a table format. Combining `Table-Driven Testing` with other testing patterns like `Given-When-Then` or `AAA` can provide a comprehensive and flexible testing strategy.

Feature of Table-Driven Testing:

- Consitency
  > Concise and readable representation of test cases and  test coverage.

- Maintenability
  > Easy to add or modify test cases without affecting the test implementation.

- Clarity
  > Simplifies the process of generating test data for a wide range of scenarios.

Example of Table-Driven Testing:

```go
func TestPercent(t *testing.T) {
  t.Parallel()

  type in struct {
    percent float64
    value   float64
  }

  type want struct {
    value float64
    err   error
  }

  tests := []struct {
    name string
    in   in
    want want
  }{
    {
      name: "valid positive input",
      in: in{
        percent: 25,
        value:   100,
      },
      want: want{
        value: 25,
        err:   nil,
      },
    },
    {
      name: "valid nagative input",
      in: in{
        percent: 50,
        value:   -200,
      },
      want: want{
        value: -100,
        err:   nil,
      },
    },
    {
      name: "invalid percentage",
      in: in{
        percent: 150,
        value:   100,
      },
      want: want{
        value: 0.0,
        err:   errors.New(out of the range),
      },
    },
  }

  for _, tt := range tests {
    t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
      got, err := percent.Percent(tt.in.percent, tt.in.value)
      if !errors.Is(err, tt.want.err) {
        t.Errorf("Percent() error = %v, want err %v", err, tt.want.err)
      }
      if !cmp.Equal(got, tt.want.value) {
        t.Errorf("Percent(%+v) = %v, want %v", tt.in, got, tt.want.value)
      }
    })
  }
}
```

> NOTE The `cmp` package is designed for testing, rather than production use. As such, it may panic when it suspects that a comparison is performed incorrectly to provide instruction to users on how to improve the test to be less brittle. Given cmp’s propensity towards panicking, it makes it unsuitable for code that is used in production as a spurious panic may be fatal.

### 1.2. Testing Techniques and Practices

#### 1.2.1. Test-Driven Development

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process in which test cases are written before any code is written. The idea behind TDD is to ensure that code is thoroughly tested and meets requirements before it is implemented, reducing the likelihood of defects and improving the overall quality of the software.

Concept of TDD:

- Write a test
  > The developer writes a test case for the functionality they want to implement, with the expectation that the test will fail because the code has not yet been written.

- Write the code
  > The developer writes the code to make the test pass. This is typically done in small, incremental steps, with each step building on the previous one.

- Run the test
  > The developer runs the test to ensure that it passes.

- Refactor the code
  > Once the test passes, the developer can refactor the code as needed to improve its design, readability, or performance.

- Repeat
  > The process is repeated for each new functionality or feature that is added to the software.

Benefits of TDD:

- Improved code quality
  > Because tests are written before the code, TDD helps ensure that the code meets requirements and is thoroughly tested.

- Faster feedback loop
  > TDD provides fast feedback on the quality of the code, allowing developers to quickly identify and fix issues.

- Reduced time and cost
  > By catching defects early in the development process, TDD can reduce the time and cost of fixing defects later on.

- Encourages better design
  > TDD encourages developers to write code that is modular, testable, and maintainable, leading to better overall software design.

#### 1.2.2. Behavior-Driven Development

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that focuses on defining the behavior of a system through the use of concrete examples expressed in natural language. It is a collaborative process that involves developers, testers, and business stakeholders working together to ensure that the system is being developed to meet the needs of its users.

Key concepts of BDD:

- User Stories
  > BDD starts with user stories, which are written in a specific format that describes the expected behavior of the system from the user's perspective.

- Examples
  > Examples are used to illustrate the behavior of the system, and they are written in natural language using a framework like Gherkin.

- Scenarios
  > Scenarios are the specific tests that are derived from the user stories and examples. They are used to ensure that the system is behaving as expected.

- Automation
  > BDD encourages the use of automation to ensure that the scenarios are executed consistently and efficiently.

- Collaboration
  > BDD is a collaborative process that involves developers, testers, and business stakeholders working together to ensure that the system is being developed to meet the needs of its users.

#### 1.2.3. Acceptance Test-Driven Development

Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) is a software development approach that aims to ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements and expectations by defining, automating, and executing acceptance tests early in the development cycle.

ATDD is an extension of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and is focused on defining and automating acceptance tests before implementing the code. The goal of ATDD is to ensure that the software satisfies the customer's acceptance criteria and to prevent defects by catching them early in the development cycle.

Concept of ATDD:

- Collaborate with stakeholders
  > The development team collaborates with the customer or product owner to define the acceptance criteria for the software.

- Define acceptance tests
  > The team defines acceptance tests based on the acceptance criteria, using a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach.

- Automate acceptance tests
  > The team automates the acceptance tests using a testing framework, such as Selenium or Cucumber.

- Implement code
  > The team implements the code to meet the acceptance criteria and passes the automated acceptance tests.

- Repeat
  > The team repeats this process for each new requirement or change in requirements.

#### 1.2.4. Test Double

Test Double is a concept from software testing and is used in the context of writing unit tests. It refers to a type of test-specific object that is used to replace a real component or collaborator within a test scenario. The purpose of using Test Doubles is to isolate the unit being tested from its dependencies or collaborators, ensuring that the test evaluates only the behavior of the unit itself.

By replacing real dependencies with Test Doubles, developers can simulate the behavior of those dependencies and create controlled testing environments. This allows for focused unit testing without the need to involve external systems or actual implementations.

##### 1.2.4.1. Mock

A mock is a Test Double that simulates the behavior of a real object and allows testers to set specific expectations and verify interactions with the unit under test.

Mocks can be used to simulate the behavior of external dependencies, such as a database or a web service, during testing, without actually executing any real logic. Mocks can be programmed to expect certain interactions with the dependencies, such as method calls or data requests, and can raise an error if those interactions do not occur as expected. This allows developers to ensure that their code is properly interacting with its dependencies, and can help catch errors or issues early in the development process.

##### 1.2.4.2. Fake

A fake is a simplified implementation of a real object, often used when the real implementation is too complex or time-consuming for testing.

##### 1.2.4.3. Stub

A stub is a simplified version of a real object that provides predefined responses to method calls. Stubs are used to return specific values to test certain scenarios.

##### 1.2.4.4. Spy

A spy is a type of Test Double that records the interactions between the unit under test and its collaborators. It allows testers to observe the behavior of the unit more closely.

#### 1.2.5. Test Fixtures

Test fixtures are a collection of setup tasks, data, and environment configuration that are used to prepare the system under test for testing. They are used in automated testing to ensure that the system under test is in a consistent and known state before executing each test.

Test Fixtures can include:

- Setup and Teardown scripts
  > These scripts are used to prepare the system under test for testing and to clean up after testing is complete.

- Test data
  > Test data is used to populate the system under test with data that will be used in the test.

- Test environment configuration
  > The test environment configuration is used to set up the environment in which the test will run, such as configuring the database, server, or other systems that the system under test interacts with.

#### 1.2.6. Code Coverage

Code coverage is a measure of how much of the source code of a software application is executed during testing. It is used to determine the effectiveness of testing and to identify any gaps in the test cases. Code coverage is usually expressed as a percentage of the total lines of code in the application.

Code coverage tools can be used to generate reports that show the percentage of code that was covered during testing, as well as highlighting any untested code.

Types of Code Coverage:

- Statement Coverage
  > This measures the percentage of statements in the source code that are executed during testing.

- Branch Coverage
  > This measures the percentage of decision points (such as if/else statements) that are executed during testing.

- Function Coverage
  > This measures the percentage of functions in the source code that are executed during testing.

- Condition Coverage
  > This measures the percentage of Boolean expressions (such as `if x > 0`) that are executed during testing.

### 1.3. Testing Types

#### 1.3.1. Functional Testing

Functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the individual components or modules of a system to ensure that they are working as expected and that they meet the specified requirements. The purpose of functional testing is to ensure that the application behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements.

Functional testing can be performed:

- Unit Testing
  > This involves testing individual units of code to ensure that they are working correctly and that they meet the specified requirements.

- Integration Testing
  > This involves testing the integration points between different components of the system to ensure that they are communicating correctly and functioning as expected.

- Regression Testing
  > This involves testing the system after a change or update has been made to ensure that existing functionality has not been affected.

- User Acceptance Testing
  > This involves testing the system with a group of end-users or customers to ensure that it meets their needs and that it is easy to use.

- Boundary Value Analysis
  > This involves testing the system with values that are at the boundaries of the specified requirements to ensure that it is handling these values correctly.

- Equivalence Partitioning
  > This involves dividing the input data into different equivalence classes and testing the system with representative values from each class to ensure that it is handling the input data correctly.

##### 1.3.1.1. Shift-Left Testing

Shift-left testing is an approach to software testing where testing activities are moved earlier in the software development life cycle. This approach emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing defects as early as possible in the development process, rather than waiting until later stages such as system or acceptance testing.

In a traditional software development model, testing is typically performed after the development phase, once the code has been completed. However, in a shift-left testing model, testing activities such as unit testing, integration testing, and functional testing are performed much earlier in the development process, often alongside the coding process.

By moving testing activities earlier in the development process, shift-left testing aims to identify and fix defects earlier, before they become more difficult and expensive to fix. This can ultimately result in higher-quality software that is delivered more quickly and at a lower cost.

Shift-left testing can be achieved through the use of automation tools and techniques such as continuous integration and continuous testing. By automating testing activities and integrating them into the development process, developers can identify and address defects in real time, as they are introduced into the code. This can help ensure that defects are caught early, before they can have a negative impact on the software or the user experience.

Shift-left testing can also help to promote a culture of quality within development teams, by emphasizing the importance of testing and quality assurance throughout the entire software development life cycle.

##### 1.3.1.2. System Testing

System testing is a type of software testing that is performed on a complete and integrated system to evaluate its compliance with the specified requirements. The objective of system testing is to ensure that the system meets the functional and non-functional requirements and works as expected in a real-world environment.

Benefits of System Testing:

- Scope
  > System testing covers the entire system and its components, including hardware, software, and networks.

- Test Environment
  > System testing is typically performed in a test environment that is similar to the production environment to ensure that the system performs as expected in a real-world environment.

- Test Types
  > System testing can involve a variety of testing types, including functional testing, performance testing, security testing, usability testing, and others, depending on the system requirements.

- Test Cases
  > System testing requires a comprehensive set of test cases that cover all the system requirements and use cases.

- Test Execution
  > System testing involves executing the test cases and analyzing the results to identify defects and issues.

- Defect Management
  > System testing requires effective defect management to track, prioritize, and resolve the defects and issues identified during testing.

- Acceptance Criteria
  > System testing includes establishing acceptance criteria to determine when the system is ready for release to production.

##### 1.3.1.3. Integration Testing

Integration testing is a type of software testing that verifies the interactions between different software components or modules to ensure that they function correctly as a group. The purpose of integration testing is to detect and resolve any issues or defects that arise due to the interactions between the components.

During integration testing, test cases are designed to test the interactions between different modules and their interfaces. The test cases should be designed to identify any errors or issues that may arise from these interactions, such as data transfer errors, incorrect function calls, and other types of interface errors.

Integration testing can be performed:

- Top-Down Integration Testing
  > This approach tests the high-level modules first, and then gradually adds lower-level modules and sub-modules for testing.

- Bottom-Up Integration Testing
  > This approach tests the lower-level modules first, and then gradually adds higher-level modules for testing.

- Big Bang Integration Testing
  > This approach tests all the modules of an application together as a whole.

- Sandwich Integration Testing
  > This approach combines the top-down and bottom-up integration testing approaches.

##### 1.3.1.4. Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the system to ensure that they meet the specified requirements and function as expected. The objective of unit testing is to detect and isolate defects early in the development cycle, before the code is integrated with other components or systems.

Unit testing can be performed:

- Test-driven development (TDD)
  > This involves writing the tests for the code before actually writing the code itself. The tests are used as a reference for writing the code and to ensure that the code meets the expected requirements.

- White-box testing
  > This involves testing the internal structures of the software, such as the code and the algorithms used, to ensure that they are functioning correctly.

- Black-box testing
  > This involves testing the external behavior of the software, without looking at its internal structures, to ensure that it is functioning correctly as per the requirements.

- Code coverage analysis
  > This involves measuring the extent to which the code has been tested, by analyzing the number of lines of code that have been executed during testing.

- Mutation testing
  > This involves introducing artificial faults or mutations into the code, to ensure that the tests are able to detect and report such faults.

Benefits of Unit Testing:

- Scope
  > Unit testing focuses on testing individual units or components of the software application, such as functions, classes, or methods.

- Test Environment
  > Unit testing is typically performed in a development environment that simulates the production environment, but with the necessary tools and frameworks to support unit testing.

- Test Types
  > Unit testing can involve a variety of testing types, such as functional testing, boundary testing, and exception testing, depending on the nature of the unit being tested.

- Test Frameworks
  > Unit testing requires a test framework, such as GTest, JUnit, NUnit, or pytest, to define test cases, execute tests, and report results.

- Test Cases
  > Unit testing requires a comprehensive set of test cases that cover all the possible scenarios and outcomes for the unit being tested.

- Test Execution
  > Unit testing involves executing the test cases and analyzing the results to identify defects and issues.

- Test Automation
  > Unit testing can be automated using continuous pipeline tools such as Jenkins or Travis CI to improve efficiency and reliability.

##### 1.3.1.5. Fuzz Testing

Fuzz testing, also known as fuzzing, is a type of software testing that involves feeding invalid, unexpected, or random data inputs to a software program to detect vulnerabilities, crashes, and other errors.

Fuzz testing can be performed manually or with the use of automated tools, which generate and feed random inputs to the software under test. The goal of fuzz testing is to uncover vulnerabilities and edge cases that might not be discovered through traditional testing methods, such as unit testing and integration testing.

Benefits of Fuzz Testing:

- Comprehensive coverage
  > Fuzz testing can provide comprehensive test coverage, as it can explore a wide range of potential input combinations that might be difficult to test manually.

- Detection of edge cases
  > Fuzz testing can help to detect edge cases and unexpected input combinations that might cause the software to crash or behave unpredictably.

- Early detection of vulnerabilities
  > Fuzz testing can help to identify vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle, which can save time and money in the long run.

- Automation
  > Fuzz testing can be automated, which can save time and effort compared to manual testing.

- Scalability
  > Fuzz testing can be scaled up to test large and complex software systems, making it suitable for testing enterprise-grade applications.

##### 1.3.1.6. Regression Testing

Regression testing is a type of software testing that verifies that changes or modifications made to the software application do not impact the existing functionality of the application. It involves re-testing the application after a change has been made to ensure that the application still performs as expected and that new changes do not introduce any new bugs or issues.

Regression testing is important to ensure that the quality of the software application is maintained throughout the development lifecycle. It is typically performed after a change has been made to the application, such as a bug fix, new feature implementation, or software upgrade.

##### 1.3.1.7. End-to-End Testing

End-to-End testing is a type of software testing that involves testing the entire software application from start to finish, simulating a real-world scenario. The purpose of end-to-end testing is to ensure that all components of the application are working together correctly and that the application meets its intended requirements.

End-to-End testing can be performed:

- Scenario Testing
  > This involves testing the system under different scenarios and user workflows to ensure that all components are working together as expected.

- Integration Testing
  > This involves testing the integration points between different components of the system to ensure that they are communicating correctly and functioning as expected.

- Data Validation
  > This involves validating the data that flows through the system to ensure that it is being processed correctly and accurately.

- User Interface Testing
  > This involves testing the user interface of the system to ensure that it is easy to use and that all functions and features are working correctly.

- Performance Testing
  > This involves testing the performance of the system under different load and stress conditions to ensure that it can handle the expected level of user traffic.

- Security Testing
  > This involves testing the security of the system to ensure that it is protected against potential threats or attacks.

##### 1.3.1.8. Acceptance Testing

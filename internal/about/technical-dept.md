# Technical Dept

Technical debt is a metaphor used in software development to describe the accumulated cost of additional work that arises when developers make trade-offs or take shortcuts that result in less-than-optimal code quality. It is similar to financial debt in that it incurs `interest` over time, resulting in additional development costs, maintenance expenses, and other indirect costs.

## 1. Category

### 1.1. Debt Types

Technical debt can be caused by various factors, including tight deadlines, changing requirements, lack of experience, and pressure to deliver results quickly. Technical debt can manifest in different forms, such as code smells, poor design, low test coverage, and inefficient algorithms.

#### 1.1.1. Design Debt

Design debt is the technical debt that arises from making trade-offs between design principles and short-term goals. It results from choosing quick and dirty solutions instead of a clean, efficient, and scalable design. Design debt can accumulate when developers neglect code maintainability and scalability while focusing on delivering functionality. This can lead to increased development and maintenance costs and impede future feature development. Examples of design debt include using inefficient data structures or algorithms, tightly coupling modules or components, and creating complex control flows.

#### 1.1.2. Code Debt

Code debt is the technical debt that results from writing code that is not optimal, maintainable, or testable. It occurs when developers use shortcuts, ignore best practices, and rush to meet deadlines. Code debt can accumulate when developers do not refactor or clean up their code, leading to code that is difficult to understand, debug, and modify. Examples of code debt include writing overly complex functions or classes, not following coding standards, and ignoring error handling.

#### 1.1.3. Test Debt

Test debt is the technical debt that arises from insufficient or inadequate testing. It results from choosing to forgo testing or writing tests that do not provide sufficient coverage. Test debt can accumulate when developers do not write automated tests or neglect to update tests as the software changes. This can lead to decreased confidence in the software's correctness, increased risk of bugs, and longer time to detect and fix issues. Examples of test debt include writing incomplete or inaccurate test cases, not testing all possible edge cases, and not testing different combinations of inputs.

#### 1.1.4. Documentation Debt

Documentation debt is the technical debt that arises from not documenting the code, architecture, or system design. It results from choosing to prioritize functionality over documentation or neglecting to update documentation as the software changes. Documentation debt can accumulate when developers do not create sufficient documentation for new features or fail to update documentation when making changes to existing features. This can lead to decreased understanding of the code, architecture, or system design, and increased difficulty in maintaining or enhancing the software. Examples of documentation debt include not providing sufficient comments in the code, not documenting the system's architecture or design decisions, and not updating user manuals or technical guides.

### 1.2. Debt Metrics

Keeping dashboards with code health metrics. These can range from dashboards that show test coverage or the number and average age of `TODO` tags, to more sophisticated dashboards including metrics like cyclomatic complexity or maintainability index.

- Bugs
  > Software developers should count and track their bugs. This includes both fixed and unfixed bugs. Noting the unfixed bugs allows development teams to focus on them and fix them during their agile iterations. Noting the fixed bugs helps teams measure how effective their tech debt management process is. Bugs on a weekly or monthly basis indicates a quality decline of the codebase.

- Code Quality
  > Code complexity can really damage the development team and the organization as a whole. Code complexity metrics are Cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, Class coupling, Lines of code, Depth of Inheritance. The lower each of these measures, the better. These metrics also helps organisations know exactly which code to rework or refactor in order to reduce complexity and improve the backend side of the software.

- Code Cohesion
  > A high code cohesion usually means that the code is more maintainable, reusable, and robust. It also minimises the amount of people who need to get involved in the code, which can greatly reduce complexity and decrease the chances of bit rot. High cohesion is when you have a class that does a well defined job.

- Code Coverage
  > A declining percentage in code coverage percentage and code coverage per feature is a signal for a growing tech debt.

- Continuous Pipelines
  > An increasing number of failed continuous pipelines is a strong indicator for instability in the codebase. This can be related to design and code debt.

- Feature Throughput
  > Days it takes to push a new feature to the main branch. It’s a supporting metric that can indicate growing tech debt. Not each feature has the same size, but if you see a decline over multiple weeks, it’s time to intervene.

- Issues with Non-functional Requirements
  > Measuring metrics such as application performance, UX (increasingly difficult to use), or loss of compatibility are solid indicators for increased technical debt.

### 1.3. Debt Impact

Technical debt can have significant impacts on software development projects and the businesses that rely on them. Effective management of technical debt is critical to minimizing these impacts and ensuring that software development projects remain on track, on budget, and deliver value to customers.

- Increased development time and costs
  > Technical debt can increase the time and costs associated with software development projects because developers may need to spend additional time refactoring code, resolving issues, and addressing technical debt items.

- Reduced Code Quality
  > Technical debt can result in reduced code quality, making the codebase more difficult to understand, read, and maintain. This can lead to increased bugs, lower productivity, and decreased developer morale.

- Increased Maintenance Expenses
  > Technical debt can result in increased maintenance expenses because the codebase may be more difficult to modify, extend, or test. This can increase the time and costs associated with fixing bugs and implementing new features.

- Decreased System Performance
  > Technical debt can negatively impact system performance because suboptimal code may be less efficient and consume more system resources. This can result in slower system performance and decreased user satisfaction.

- Decreased Innovation
  > Technical debt can limit innovation because developers may be forced to spend more time addressing technical debt items instead of working on new features and functionality.

- Increased Business Risk
  > Technical debt can increase business risk because it can result in system downtime, security vulnerabilities, and decreased customer satisfaction. These risks can have significant financial and reputational impacts on businesses.

Technical debt can have a significant impact on developer psychology, affecting their motivation, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. Effective management of technical debt is critical for ensuring that developers can perform their job effectively and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

- Frustration and Demotivation
  > Dealing with technical debt can be frustrating and demotivating for developers. Technical debt can make it difficult to achieve project goals, lead to increased rework and debugging, and result in a lack of progress. This can lead to frustration and demotivation among developers, making it difficult for them to stay engaged and productive.

- Burnout
  > Technical debt can contribute to developer burnout, a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress and overwork. Developers may feel overwhelmed and unsupported when dealing with technical debt, leading to burnout and a decrease in overall job satisfaction.

- Imposter Syndrome
  > Developers may experience imposter syndrome, a feeling of inadequacy and self-doubt, when dealing with technical debt. Technical debt can make developers feel like they are not doing their job effectively, leading to a lack of confidence and feelings of inadequacy.

- Quality of Work
  > Technical debt can impact the quality of work produced by developers. When technical debt is not properly managed, developers may be forced to take shortcuts and make compromises in the quality of their work, leading to a decrease in code quality and technical debt accumulation over time.

- Team Dynamics
  > Technical debt can also impact team dynamics, causing tension and conflict among team members. When technical debt is not properly managed, it can result in finger-pointing and blame-shifting, leading to a breakdown in communication and collaboration.

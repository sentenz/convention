# Conventional Commits

A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages. The [Conventional Commits](https://sentenz.github.io/backup-service/website/conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/index.html) specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, which helps to write automated tools on top of.

This convention dovetails with [SemVer](https://sentenz.github.io/backup-service/website/semver.org/index.html), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

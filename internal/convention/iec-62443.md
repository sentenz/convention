IEC 62443-1-3 provides a systematic approach to defining and measuring system security compliance metrics for IACS. This can help organizations ensure that their IACS meet the necessary security requirements and provide a high level of protection against cyber threats.

The standard defines several key concepts related to system security compliance metrics, including:

- Security level (SL)
  > A measure of the degree of protection provided by a security control or set of controls.

- Security assurance level (SAL)
  > A measure of the confidence that a security control or set of controls will perform its intended function in a given environment.

- Security capability level (SCL)
  > A measure of the degree to which a security control or set of controls can meet the security requirements of a given environment.

- Security compliance level (SCL)
  > A measure of the degree to which a system meets the security requirements specified in a security policy or standard.

IEC 62443-1-3 provides a framework for defining and measuring system security compliance metrics based on these concepts. The framework includes four key steps:

- Define security requirements
  > The first step is to define the security requirements for the system based on the security policy or standard. This includes defining the SLs for each security control and the overall system.

- Assess security capability
  > The next step is to assess the security capability of the system by evaluating the effectiveness of each security control in meeting its SL.

- Evaluate security assurance
  > The third step is to evaluate the security assurance of the system by assessing the confidence that each security control will perform its intended function in the given environment.

- Measure compliance
  > The final step is to measure the security compliance of the system by comparing the security capability and security assurance levels to the security requirements.

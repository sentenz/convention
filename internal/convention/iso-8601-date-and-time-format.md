# ISO 8601 Date and Time Format

The [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) standard helps to eliminate uncertainties arising from the different date conventions, cultures, and time zones that affect global operations. It enables the representation of dates and times that is defined and understandable to humans and machines.

ISO 8601 eliminates this uncertainty by specifying an internationally accepted method for representing dates `YYYY-MM-DD`.

For example, `September 27, 2012` is represented as `2012-09-27`.

Standardized way of presenting:

- Date
- Time of day
- Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
- Local time with offset to UTC
- Date and time
- Time intervals
- Recurring time intervals

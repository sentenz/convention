# POSIX

The Portable Operating System Interface [POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/) is a group of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society to maintain compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines both system- and user-level application programming interfaces (API), as well as command-line shells and utility interfaces, to ensure software compatibility (portability) with variants of Unix and other operating systems.

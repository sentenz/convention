# Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning [SemVer](https://sentenz.github.io/backup-service/website/semver.org/index.html), is a widely-adopted version scheme that uses a three-part version number (Major.Minor.Patch), an optional pre-release tag, and an optional build meta tag. The presence of a pre-release tag (-alpha, -beta) indicates a work-in-progress that may contain any level of potentially breaking changes.

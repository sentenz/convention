## 1. GitOps

[GitOps](../about/xops.md#2-gitops) is a DevOps methodology that leverages the Git version control system as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application code.

The GitOps process can be divided into several stages or categories, including:

- Review
  > Teams review and approve code changes and infrastructure updates through `Pull Requests`. Code review is ensuring that the code meets the quality standards and requirements. Review may involve automated tests and peer reviews to ensure that the code is efficient, reliable, and secure.

- Merge
  > Teams merge approved changes to the base branch of the Git repository, triggering an automated deployment pipeline. Merging is ensuring that the code changes are integrated and tested before deployment. The deployment pipeline may include automated testing, building, and packaging the code for deployment.
  >
  > This stage includes the categories:
  >
  > - [Merging Strategies](../about/merging-strategies.md)
  > - [Branching Strategies](../about/branching-strategies.md)
  > - [Conventional Commits](../convention/conventional-commits.md)
  > - [Semantic Versioning](../convention/semantic-versioning.md)
  > - [Changelog](../convention/changelog.md)

- Auditing Complaince
  > Software vendors conduct software compliance audits to verify adherence to the contracts and license terms they have concluded.

- Rollback
  > Teams have the option to roll back changes when an issue is detected in the production environment. Rollback involves reverting to a previous version of the infrastructure or application code, providing a quick solution to any issues that may arise.

## 2. DevOps

[DevOps](../about/xops.md#1-devops) is a software development practice that combines software development and information technology operations to streamline the software delivery process. It aims to increase collaboration and communication between development and operations teams, automate the software delivery pipeline, and promote a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. DevOps is based on the principles of Agile development and focuses on delivering high-quality software quickly, efficiently, and at a low cost. Key practices include continuous integration and deployment, automation, testing, and monitoring. DevOps helps organizations to respond faster to changing customer demands, improve software quality and reliability, and increase operational efficiency.

The DevOps process can be divided into several stages or categories, including:

### 3.4. Signing Containers

Signing containers is an important aspect of DevSecOps. Containers are used to package applications and dependencies in a portable format that can be deployed across different environments. However, since containers can be easily tampered with, it is essential to sign containers to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

Integrating container signing into the DevSecOps process, teams can ensure that their container images are authentic, tamper-proof, and free from vulnerabilities. This helps to reduce the risk of security incidents and ensure compliance with industry regulations.

Signing containers can be integrated into the DevSecOps process:

- Plan
  > During the planning stage, teams should identify the types of containers that will be signed. Teams should also identify the tools and processes that will be used to sign the containers.

- Develop
  > During the development stage, teams should implement signing into their container images. This includes using digital signatures to ensure that the container image is coming from a trusted source, and implementing checksums to detect unauthorized changes.

- Test
  > During the testing stage, teams should perform security testing to ensure that the signed container images are working as expected. This includes testing the integrity of the signed container images to ensure that they are not vulnerable to attacks.

- Deploy
  > During the deployment stage, signed container images should be deployed using automated tools. This includes deploying signed containers to the target environment.

- Monitor
  > During the monitoring stage, teams should continuously monitor the signed container images to identify any security incidents. Teams should analyze the data collected to identify and respond to any security incidents promptly.
